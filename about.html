                                I am a Penn State 2020 grad with a degree in Information Sciences and Technology and a minor in Security Risk Analysis. At Penn State, I was involved with the student-run philanthropy, THON, and the student-run VC organization, Happy Valley Capital. During my senior year, I become a Research Assistant in the Office of Disability Services, helping to make learning software for those in the blind community. Outside of school, I interned at Goldman Sachs and Dynamo VC as an Operations Analyst.  On the side, I helped market for Fitted Laundry (Chute), a startup on campus that has now grown exponentially across several schools in the country.
                                
                                Growing up, I lived in Germany. When I was sixteen, I moved with my family to Maryland, where I attended my third high school. Growing up a Third Culture Kid and moving around frequently has helped shaped me to become who I am today.
                                
                                Currently, I host a podcast called Braun & Brains where I sit down and interview twenty-somethings with unique backgrounds and career paths. I am driven by purpose, and I hope that my podcast inspires others to find their purpose in life and explore different fields.
